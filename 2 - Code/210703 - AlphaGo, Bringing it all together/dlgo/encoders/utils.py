    """Ladders are played out in reversed roles, one player tries to capture,
    the other to escape. We determine the ladder status by recursively calling
    is_ladder in opposite roles, providing suitable capture or escape candidates.

    Arguments:
    try_capture: boolean flag to indicate if you want to capture or escape the ladder
    game_state: current game state, instance of GameState
    candidate: a move that potentially leads to escaping the ladder or capturing it, instance of Move
    ladder_stones: the stones to escape or capture, list of Point. Will be inferred if not provided.
    recursion_depth: when to stop recursively calling this function, integer valued.

    Returns True if game state is a ladder and try_capture is true (the ladder captures)
    or if game state is not a ladder and try_capture is false (you can successfully escape)
    and False otherwise.
